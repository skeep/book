# Building our first Application using Angular2

In this chapter we will learn how to build a simple Angular2 app using typeScript, that shows `Hello World` in a webpage .

## webpack

webpack is a module bundler. We will use webpack to load and complie our typeScript files, split code base into chunks. And use webpack-dev-server to serve the static assets from our local server. 

## Directory structure


##Files

 Entry point of our app will be main.ts . We can use different platforms (browser, server) to render an Angular2 app. Here we will be loading it in a browser, so importing module 
`bootstrap` from `angular2/platform/browser`..  

```javaScript
// app/main.ts 

import {bootstrap}    from 'angular2/platform/browser'
import {AppComponent} from './app.component'

bootstrap(AppComponent);
```

`AppComponent` is our main module that will render a `header` tag  with text `Hello World` in a selector named `my-app`.

```javaScript
// app/app.component.ts
import {Component} from 'angular2/core';

@Component({
    selector: 'my-app',
    template: '<h1>Hello World</h1>'
})
export class AppComponent { }

```

We will have a `HTML` file which will load all our `javaScript` and `css` files.
`<my-app></my-app>` is the selector where template provided by `app/app.component.ts` will be loaded.

```html
//index.html
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Angular 2 QuickStart</title>
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">    
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles/global.css">
  </head>

  <body>
    <my-app>Loading...</my-app>
    <script src="dist/shims.js"></script>
    <script src="dist/main.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>

// Our css file is preety small
//styles/global.css
body{
	background: #3B73B3;
}
``` 
Our `index.html` is loading two js files `dist/shims.js` and `dist/main.js`. Here webpack comes into picture. These 2 files are generated by `webpack` and placed into `dist` folder.
we need to install `webpack` globally with `npm install webpack -g`. And we need to pass following config file to `webpack`. 

```javaScript
//webpack.config.js
module.exports = {
    entry: {
     main: "./app/main.ts",
     shims: ['es6-shim', 'angular2/bundles/angular2-polyfills.js']
    },
    output: {
        path: __dirname,
        filename: "./dist/[name].js"
    },
    resolve: {
        extensions: ['', '.js', '.ts']
    },
    module: {
        loaders: [
            { test: /\.ts?$/, loader: 'ts-loader' }
        ]
    }
};
```
Let's discuss this `config` file in details .`entry` denotes starting point for `webpack`. It will compile your files and create bundled file. Here we have two entry points, namely `main` and `shims`. `output` defines where these compiled files will be placed. `webpack` will load `./app/main.ts`, compile, bundle and them place it at `./dist/main.js` (In output filename `[name].js` is a place holder that gets substituted by entry point key ). `es6-shim.js` and `angular2-polyfills.js` files will be bundled together (more about these files later) and placed at `./dist/shims.js`.
